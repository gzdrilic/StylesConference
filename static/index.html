        <h2>Dedicated to the art of helping young people avoid the pitfals of unexperienced deciosion making around career choice and future work, such an important decision and season in life for the life ahead.</h2>
        <p> Every month my colleague Martina and I gather together and organize group training to discuss the best possible careeer options for young people, according to their personality, life experiences, and to help them make an informed and self-aware carere decision.
             This doesn't mean you will just listen and absorb, as a plant, you also will be doing asignments and have work to do during our coaching sesions in order to get the best results and make them stick. </p>
